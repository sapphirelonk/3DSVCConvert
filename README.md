# 3DSVCConvert
For converting SNES-emulator saves to 3DS Virtual Console and back!  
# Disclaimer
As with nearly all things concerning CFW, there is a (in this case: really, really, really small) probability that things will break, your console could become bricked, etc.  
Please note, that in any case, I am not responsible for any damage!  
# About
I wrote this program as a small "scribble-together" in one afternoon and only tested it on one game, so it is perfectly possible that it may not work in every use case!  
It's also due to this that I did not implement a GUI, but I hope that anyone able to install [Python3] and open these files in a text editor of their choice should be able to manage...  
# Thanks  
Enormous thanks and a big shoutout go out [this person on GBATemp][gbatemp]. This project wouldn't have been possible without their research!  
All I really had to do was to take the tutorial there and automate it using Python, so again: Big thanks!  
# FAQ  
#### How do I use this?  
1. Install [Python3] for your platform.  
2. Download the raw python files from this repository.  
3. Place the files in the same directory as these scripts.  
4. Open the files in a text editor of your choice and change the user-variables, adding the file names (between the double qoutes).  
5. Run the script(s) for the desired conversion(s).  

#### Will this work with my Wii-U Virtual-Console-titles?  
Probably not.  
There were mentions on GBAtemp about the header requiring some more values on which I wasn't able to find any more information.  
If these scripts fit your purpose or work with your Wii-U-use-case: That's great!  
However, I am pretty sure, they're not going to work and I currently do not have a Wii-U to test this on.
