# 3DSVCConvert
For converting SNES-emulator saves to 3DS Virtual Console and back!
# About
I wrote this program as a small "scribble-together" in one afternoon and only tested it on one game, so it is perfectly possible that it may not work in every use case!  
It's also due to this that I did not implement a GUI, but I hope that anyone able to install [Python3] and open these files in a text editor of their choice should be able to manage...
# Thanks
Enormous thanks and a big shoutout go out [this person on GBATemp][gbatemp]. This project wouldn't have been possible without their research!
